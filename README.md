Dictionary app made using the Dictionary API : https://dictionaryapi.dev/

Currently the user can type a word into the searchbar, and the app will return its pronounciation, meanings and a pronounciation sound the user can play by pressing the red button.

TODO : Light/Dark mode toggle, visual rework so it doesn't look so barren, fixing the pronounciation sound and implement proper error messages and handling.
